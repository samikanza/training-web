## **Presentations**
<br>

**Characteristics of data** ([Slides](/resources/ODP_Charecteristics.pdf))

We recap the pre-training exercise and look at perceptions of what data is.  
 
**Data discovery patters** ([Slides](/resources/ODP_Data_Discovery_Patterns.pdf))

How do you discover data on the web? What if you are looking for something that doesnt fit the pattern?

Looks at the different solutions and tools to help you publish high quality open data.
